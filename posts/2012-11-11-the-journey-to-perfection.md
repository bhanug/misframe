I start many things. I never finish anything. For some reason, I think of “finishing” as perfecting. I never think of something I create to be perfect. That’s just unrealistic. So here I am with a mountain of works in progress.

Writing
----
I think about writing all the time. I’ve been thinking about a certain blog post for months. I think about it when I’m walking to a class, in the bathroom (seriously), or when I’m trying to fall asleep. It’s always in my head, but never out. I have this issue of not taking the time to write down my thoughts. I don’t want to do it because while it makes complete sense for me, it ultimately ends up being incoherent for others. I end up not writing fearing imperfection.

Guitar
----
I really like learning Joe Satriani songs. He’s an amazing guitarist and I aspire to be a guitarist at his level. One of my favorite songs has to be *Summer Song.* I distinctly remember the summer of 2009 -- tethering my phone to my laptop and listening to Summer Song on YouTube. It’s an amazing song and I love to play however much I know. It’s been about three years now, and I still haven’t finished learning that song. I keep putting off the rest simply because I want to improve the parts I already know.

“Good enough.”
----
I need to stop treating completion as a single target. Work needs iterations. This will sound cliche, but it’s true: perfection is a journey. I need to get into that mindset. This post is *good enough.* This blog platform is *good enough.* This design is *good enough.* I’m not going to start or finish anything with perfection in mind. That would be misframing.
