I sleep for 8 hours (overestimate). I intern for another 8. Since there are 24 hours in a day (right?), I'm left with 8 hours. With those 8 hours, I need to eat, cook, go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, get around, and so on.

Let's see... I'm a university student, I'm interning at a database startup, and I run a web hosting company. As a student, I'm surrounded by people my age. I have a social life (I think... O.O). As an intern, my job is to learn and work for a company. As a founder of a company, I have to sell a product, support it, be there when things break (and they do too often!), and so on. I'm also a human being. I need sleep. I need breaks. I need to take care of myself.

There's just *way* too much to do. At the moment, the most important thing I can do is spend my 8 hours wisely. It's hard! Sometimes certain things come up and I'm forced to make changes. I can't set a fixed schedule, since I usually end up outside of it.

Something important to think about is taking breaks. Sometimes, people like to take breaks often when they're working on something that takes a long time, but I don't think that's the best way to do things. I guess it depends on the breaks. Make sure those breaks are actually *breaks* and not *distractions.* Remember, [context switching](http://misfra.me/mastering-the-art-of-context-switching) is expensive.

[Usnish](http://usnish.com/) has been telling me a lot about Tim Ferriss and his [Four Hour Work Week](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/). It sounds great, doesn't it? With a lot of work, he manages to go from 8 hours a day to less than one.  While I don't think I can do what he did, nor do I think it's a good idea, I have a lot of respect for him. He figured out what was wrong and decided to act on it. And it works.

So, that's about it. I know I'm quite busy this summer. I don't have a lot of time. I know I can't do everything I want to do. I honestly don't think I should. I'd rather focus my (limited) time on a few things rather than spread it across multiple things. How do you minimize the risk of failure? You plan ahead. You know how I am at planning -- this blog is called *Misframe* for a reason.
