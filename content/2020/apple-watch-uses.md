Two years ago I didn't want to get an Apple Watch. I wanted a
Fitbit Alta HR because I had an older Alta without heart rate
monitoring, and that was the only feature I really wanted.

The Fitbit tracked my steps and sleep, alerted me to calls, texts, and
calendar events. I thought if I add heart rate monitoring
then I'd be getting pretty much the same capabilities as
an Apple Watch. So I ordered a Fitbit Alta HR on Amazon.

Immediately after ordering the Fitbit I started reading more
about the Apple Watch and, well, started rethinking my decision.
Anyway, the Fitbit [got lost](https://twitter.com/PreetamJinka/status/1049212214937374720?s=20)
during shipping and I took it as a sign and ordered an Apple Watch instead ðŸ˜….

Two years (and an upgrade to a Series 5) later and I am still wearing
and liking an Apple Watch. Here's everything I use it for, which is
way more than what I expected when I first decided to get one.

#### Notifications

* Emails
	* I can also delete and archive from the watch, which is super handy.
* Calendar events
* Texts

#### Health

* Workout tracking
* HR

#### Media

* Play, pause, and skip music or videos
* Adjust the volume on my iPhone or Bluetooth devices (e.g. AirPods)

#### Misc

* Taking calls (sometimes my phone is out of reach)
* Unlocking my MacBook Pro
* Apple Pay
* Duo push
* iPhone camera preview
* Maps and directions
* Timers (useful for cooking)

Oh yeah, and it tells time ([very accurately](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-the-most-accurate-timepiece-156700)).

### What I'm looking forward to

I'm excited about the new sleep tracking feature coming in the next version of watchOS.
That's one feature I lost after moving away from the Fitbit.

I wish Google Fi supported the Apple Watch. I have the cellular model and it would be
great to be able to go on runs without having my phone with me. They now support eSIM for
iPhones and I was able to switch so hopefully Apple Watch support will come soon too.

### Is it worth it?

When I first ordered the Apple Watch I thought it was _really_ expensive. After a couple of years
of discovering a more uses (and many more to come) I think $399 is a great deal. If you already
have an iPhone and other Apple devices like a MacBook or AirPods, the Watch makes all of them
even better.
