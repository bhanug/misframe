This is just my opinion. I don't like career fairs. I don't think they are of any value *to me.* Most people might disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool. I'm not like most people.

Career fairs are way too competitive. It's probably *the worst* place to differentiate yourself. Everyone's in a suit. Everyone's carrying around their resumes, and everyone basically gives the same rehearsed intro, right? It's also annoying to think that there will always be someone better than you out there. A nicer resume, a higher GPA, a better suit, etc.

Technical interviews sound horrible. I've never had one like the ones I hear people talk about. The most I've had to do was hand someone my resume and just chat about what I've worked on, and I *love* doing that! Those puzzle things sound horrible too. Have you seen [TJ Holowaychuk's response](http://f.cl.ly/items/313L3D1K0G102P0z0B0I/Screen%20Shot%202012-07-18%20at%2012.35.56%20PM.png) to a Facebook recruiter? I feel like I'd do something like that too.

Anyway, that's what I'm thinking about these days as I see students walk around all dressed up to impress potential employers. Just another part of [working and growing up](http://misfra.me/working-and-growing-up).

How can you be exceptional without being an exception? Are you just going to join some big crowd and hope you're going to get picked?
